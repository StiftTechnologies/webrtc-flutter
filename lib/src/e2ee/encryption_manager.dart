///
/// ```dart
/// final e2ee = EncryptionManager.create(userId: myUserId);
/// await e2ee.setSharedKey(0, keyBytes); // 16 bytes for AES-128
///
/// // Publishing.
/// await e2ee.encrypt(sender, codec: 'vp8', trackType: E2eeTrackType.video);
///
/// // Subscribing. Match the receiver by `track.id`, never by identity.
/// await e2ee.decrypt(receiver, userId: remoteUserId,
///     trackType: E2eeTrackType.video);
/// ```
